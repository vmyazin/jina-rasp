# Simplified Data Validation Pipeline Tasks

## Focus: Address immediate data quality issues in the insurance broker directory

This simplified version focuses on the essential validation needs to clean up existing data and prevent future data quality issues.

## Priority Tasks (Essential)

### 1. Basic Field Validation

- [x] **1.1 Required Field Validator**

  - Check that name, phone, and email are present and not empty
  - Simple validation - no complex parsing or standardization
  - Return pass/fail with list of missing fields

- [x] **1.2 Phone Number Cleanup**

  - Basic phone format validation for Brazilian numbers
  - Remove invalid characters (letters, special chars except -, (), spaces)
  - Standardize to consistent format: (XX) XXXXX-XXXX
  - Flag obviously invalid numbers (too short/long, all zeros)

- [x] **1.3 Email Format Validation**
  - Basic email regex validation
  - Convert to lowercase and trim whitespace
  - Flag malformed emails for manual review

### 2. Duplicate Detection (Basic)

- [x] **2.1 Simple Duplicate Detection**
  - Match on identical phone numbers or emails
  - Flag exact name matches for manual review
  - No complex similarity algorithms - keep it simple

### 3. Data Cleanup Script

- [x] **3.1 One-time Cleanup Script**
  - Run validation on existing database records
  - Generate report of issues found
  - Provide list of records needing manual attention
  - Simple fix for obvious issues (phone formatting, email case)

### 4. Integration with Existing System

- [x] **4.1 Update Data Import Process**
  - Add validation to `consolidate_data.js`
  - Reject records missing required fields
  - Clean phone/email formats during import
  - Log validation issues for review

## Optional Enhancements (Future)

### 5. Quality Scoring (Simple)

- [x] **5.1 Basic Completeness Score**
  - Count filled vs empty fields
  - Calculate percentage completeness per record
  - No complex weighting - all fields equal

### 6. Basic Reporting

- [x] **6.1 Simple Validation Report**
  - JSON output with validation results
  - Count of issues by type
  - List of records needing attention
  - No fancy dashboards or alerts

## What We're NOT Implementing (Yet)

‚ùå Complex similarity algorithms  
‚ùå Real-time API endpoints  
‚ùå Advanced enrichment services  
‚ùå Alerting systems  
‚ùå Complex reporting dashboards  
‚ùå Neighborhood extraction/inference  
‚ùå Website URL validation  
‚ùå Plugin architecture  
‚ùå Database schema changes  
‚ùå Monitoring systems

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ All existing records have name, phone, email
- ‚úÖ Phone numbers in consistent format
- ‚úÖ No obvious duplicates in database
- ‚úÖ Clean data import process prevents bad data
- ‚úÖ Simple report identifies remaining issues

## Time Estimate: 1-2 weeks vs 8+ weeks for full version

This simplified approach gets 80% of the data quality benefits with 20% of the complexity.

  - Automatic formatting to (XX) XXXXX-XXXX standard
  - Detects obviously invalid numbers
  - Normalization and cleanup capabilities

- **Email Validator** (`email-validator.js`)
  - Comprehensive email format validation
  - Automatic normalization (lowercase, trim)
  - Suspicious email pattern detection
  - Detailed error reporting with severity levels

#### 2. Advanced Validation Features

- **Duplicate Detector** (`duplicate-detector.js`)

  - Exact match detection on phone, email, name
  - Intelligent grouping of potential duplicates
  - Manual review flagging for ambiguous cases
  - Merge strategy recommendations

- **Completeness Scorer** (`completeness-scorer.js`)
  - Field-by-field completeness analysis
  - Percentage scoring for each record
