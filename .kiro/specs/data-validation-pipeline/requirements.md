# Requirements Document - Data Validation Pipeline

## Introduction

The Insurance Broker Directory currently contains data quality issues that impact user experience and system reliability. Scraped data contains incomplete records, inconsistent formatting, and missing validation checks. This feature will implement a comprehensive data validation pipeline to ensure high-quality, consistent broker information throughout the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated data quality validation, so that all broker records meet minimum quality standards before being stored in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a broker record is processed THEN the system SHALL validate that required fields (name, phone, email) are present and not null
2. WHEN a broker record contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL flag the record with specific validation errors
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details and continue processing other records
4. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL mark the record as validated and ready for database insertion

### Requirement 2: Data Completeness Scoring

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to see completeness scores for broker records, so that I can identify and prioritize data improvement efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a broker record is validated THEN the system SHALL calculate a completeness score based on filled vs total fields
2. WHEN the completeness score is below 70% THEN the system SHALL flag the record as incomplete
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include completeness statistics by neighborhood and specialty
4. WHEN displaying broker data THEN the system SHALL show completeness indicators to help users understand data quality

### Requirement 3: Data Format Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data formats across all broker records, so that the application can reliably process and display information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing phone numbers THEN the system SHALL standardize format to (XX) XXXXX-XXXX pattern
2. WHEN processing email addresses THEN the system SHALL validate format and normalize to lowercase
3. WHEN processing addresses THEN the system SHALL standardize neighborhood names against a predefined list
4. WHEN processing specialties THEN the system SHALL map variations to standard specialty codes (auto, vida, residencial, empresarial, saude, viagem)
5. WHEN processing ratings THEN the system SHALL ensure values are between 0.0 and 5.0 with one decimal place

### Requirement 4: Duplicate Detection and Merging

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want automatic duplicate detection, so that the database contains unique broker records without redundancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing broker records THEN the system SHALL identify potential duplicates based on name similarity, phone, and email
2. WHEN duplicates are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate a confidence score for the match
3. WHEN confidence score exceeds 85% THEN the system SHALL automatically merge records, keeping the most complete data
4. WHEN confidence score is between 60-85% THEN the system SHALL flag for manual review
5. WHEN merging records THEN the system SHALL preserve all unique information and maintain audit trail

### Requirement 5: Data Enrichment and Correction

**User Story:** As a user, I want complete and accurate broker information, so that I can make informed decisions when choosing insurance services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a broker record has missing neighborhood THEN the system SHALL attempt to extract it from the address
2. WHEN a broker record has incomplete specialties THEN the system SHALL suggest specialties based on company name or description
3. WHEN a broker record has invalid website URL THEN the system SHALL attempt to correct common formatting issues
4. WHEN enrichment is applied THEN the system SHALL mark fields as auto-corrected for transparency
5. WHEN manual corrections are made THEN the system SHALL preserve original values for audit purposes

### Requirement 6: Validation Reporting and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation reports, so that I can monitor data quality trends and identify systemic issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports showing pass/fail rates by validation rule
2. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (critical, warning, info)
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include trends over time and comparisons to previous runs
4. WHEN critical issues exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL export them in both JSON and human-readable formats

### Requirement 7: Data Migration and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up existing data, so that historical records meet the same quality standards as new data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running data migration THEN the system SHALL apply all validation rules to existing database records
2. WHEN existing records fail validation THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic correction where possible
3. WHEN automatic correction is not possible THEN the system SHALL create a cleanup task list for manual review
4. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide before/after statistics showing improvement metrics
5. WHEN cleanup tasks are resolved THEN the system SHALL update records and mark them as validated

### Requirement 8: Real-time Validation API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time validation endpoints, so that data quality checks can be integrated into all data entry points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the validation API receives a broker record THEN it SHALL return validation results within 200ms
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the API SHALL return specific error messages and suggested corrections
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the API SHALL return the standardized record with completeness score
4. WHEN the API is called THEN it SHALL log validation attempts for monitoring and analytics
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the API SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry guidance
