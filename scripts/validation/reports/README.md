- `*-2025-*.json` - Timestamped validation reports with detailed data
- `*-2025-*.txt` - Human-readable validation summaries  
- `database-validation-report.*` - Live production database quality assessments
- `file-validation-report.*` - File-based validation results
- `import-validation-*` - Data import process validation results
- `validation-stress-test-*` - Comprehensive system testing results

### 📋 **Report Categories**

#### 🎯 **Import Validation Reports**
